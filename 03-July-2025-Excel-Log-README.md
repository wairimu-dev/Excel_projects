## ðŸ“… 03 July 2025 â€“ Excel Deep Dive: Grouping, VLOOKUP & Logic Clicks

Today was all about **clarity and foundational sharpening**.

### âœ… What I Practiced:
- ðŸ“Œ **Data validation**: Creating dropdown lists (manual and dynamic using `SEQUENCE`)
- ðŸ“Œ **Filtering and sorting** student data by gender and performance
- ðŸ“Œ **Grouping and ungrouping rows** â€“ learned the difference between *outline grouping* and *logical grouping* using sorting/pivot tables
- ðŸ“Œ **VLOOKUP troubleshooting**:
  - Understood the importance of lookup value being in the **first column**
  - Fixed #N/A errors by adjusting the lookup range and column index
  - Practiced using VLOOKUP to return values like *Item*, *Category*, *Unit Price* based on *Code*

### ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
- Excelâ€™s **"Group"** button is for collapsing/expanding sections â€” not for grouping categories like Male/Female unless sorted
- **Sorting** is the easiest way to group values visually
- VLOOKUP canâ€™t "look left" â€” learned how to structure tables accordingly
- **Slow practice + surf mode = steady growth**
- No rush. Iâ€™m laying the foundation now so I can build real projects later with confidence

### ðŸ’¬ Reflection:
I'm proud of todayâ€™s work. I now understand not just *how* to use tools, but *why* they behave the way they do. Itâ€™s all starting to click ðŸ”„

I also reviewed what APIs are and noted them down for deeper study later. Focus for July-August remains on theory + light practice for Excel, SQL, Power BI, Python, and R.

ðŸ”„ Consistency > Intensity.
